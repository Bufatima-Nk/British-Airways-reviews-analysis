# British Airways Reviews Analysis Project

## Overview

Welcome to the British Airways Reviews Analysis Project repository! This project focuses on extracting customer reviews from the Skytrax website, performing sentiment analysis, and uncovering key topics using topic modeling techniques. The goal is to gain insights into customer sentiments and identify common themes within the reviews.

## Project Goals

The primary objectives of this project are:

- Collect British Airways customer reviews from [Skytrax](https://www.airlinequality.com).
- Perform sentiment analysis to understand the emotional tone of the reviews.
- Apply topic modeling (LDA) to categorize reviews into distinct topics.
- Visualize the results to provide insights into customer sentiments and topics.

## Data Source

The reviews used in this analysis were scraped from the [Skytrax website](https://www.airlinequality.com), focusing specifically on British Airways.

## Project Files

The key files in this repository are:

- `ba_task1.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data collection, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling.
- `Key-Insights-Task1-BA.pdf`: A PDF document summarizing the main findings and insights from Task 1.

## Libraries Used

This project leverages the following Python libraries:

- BeautifulSoup: Web scraping and data extraction.
- NLTK: Sentiment analysis and text preprocessing.
- Gensim: Topic modeling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).
- Matplotlib and Seaborn: Data visualization.

## How to Run

To replicate the analysis on your own system:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Open the `ba_task1.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook and execute each cell to perform data collection, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling.
4. Review the `Key-Insights-Task1-BA.pdf` document to understand the main findings from Task 1.
